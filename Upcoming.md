Ukraine is still under brutal Russian invasion. A lot of Ukrainian people are hurt, without shelter and need help. You can help in various ways, for instance, directly helping refugees, spreading awareness, putting pressure on your local government or companies. You can also support Ukraine by donating e.g. to [Red Cross](https://redcross.org.ua/en/), [Ukraine humanitarian organisation](https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/). You may also consider joining [Tech for Ukraine](https://techtotherescue.org/tech/tech-for-ukraine) initiative.

### Architecture

- [Werner Vogels](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/), CTO of Amazon.com, opened Amazon's [Distributed Computing Manifesto](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2022/11/amazon-1998-distributed-computing-manifesto.html), originally published in 1998. A canonical document from the early days of Amazon that transformed the architecture of Amazon’s ecommerce platform.

### Python

- Lex Friedman released a great conversation with [Guido van Rossum](https://twitter.com/gvanrossum), creator of Python. As usual for Lex, a long, but really interesting conversation with an amazing guest. Recommended to watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I) or listen to on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Kzh367y0yCxFe2Ywv5Qj6?si=9b412aaad1494b9f).

### AI & Data Science
- The biggest news of the last week, *correct* possibly the whole year, is [Meta's CICERO](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people/), an AI agent that plays Diplomacy better than 90% of human players. A favorite game of JFK, Kissinger, and DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis. Extremely challenging, requires multiplayer collaboration, persuasion, and backstabbing!
  - Why is it such a groundbraking model? CICERO addresses two massive questions (more in the [published paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097)):
    - How to integrate planning & RL (eg. AlphaZero) with dialogue (eg. GPT-3).
    - How to learn and plan in settings with both competition and cooperation, where agents must understand human intentions"

- The second big news is new version of the Stable Diffusion model - hugely successful open source model gets an amazing reworked version. See [official announcement](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-v2-release) or head directly to [GitHub](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion), and a [5 minute guide on how to try it yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgoxZe-eGic).
- NVidia releases Magic3D - a text-to-3D content creation model that creates 3d mesh models with textures.
