Ukraine is still under brutal Russian invasion. A lot of Ukrainian people are hurt, without shelter and need help. You can help in various ways, for instance, directly helping refugees, spreading awareness, putting pressure on your local government or companies. You can also support Ukraine by donating e.g. to [Red Cross](https://redcross.org.ua/en/), [Ukraine humanitarian organisation](https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/). You may also consider joining [Tech for Ukraine](https://techtotherescue.org/tech/tech-for-ukraine) initiative.
